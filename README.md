# Who am I?

Hi, I am Bluntano. A dumb Estonian who likes to do fun multimedia stuff on the internet.

## School / Job

I finished vocational school / college, and by speciality I am Junior IT-Systems Specialist. To list off what that specialist does, are the following: computer management, on both hardware and software, repairs, diagnostics, builds, components, operating systems, applications (also learn them as well), scripting; server management, mentioned stuff from computer management, setting up different servers like web, application, DHCP, DNS, NAT, NFS, etc., automation; networking, the basis of networking and making one, managing a network; documentation; configurations; user support; knows the basis of security; communication, collaboration (virtually and in person), different projections, leadership, customer service; and so on. Tried to mention all important ones, hopefully I didn't miss one. I had two years of school and within those two years I had two internships: Hardware and Networking Internship on first year, and IT-Systems Management Internship on second year.

## Programming

I do programming, I'm heavily self-taught on my own time but, as well did at school since I picked Programming / Web Development module. I like back-end development and a bit of front-end too. I'm more familiar with bot development as I've done countless of Discord bots with different ideas, Twitter bots, and Twitch chatbots now recently.

### At school

I picked Programming module for my second year of vocational school because, it generally interested me and, I wanted to try it out. The module consists of learning the basis of programming as a whole, leaning more towards to web development; coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript; MySQL Projection (was familiar with MySQL from first year); learned one CSS framework: Bootstrap; learning about the basis of CMS (Content Management Systems) and setting up WordPress accordingly; learning web programming (a bit of back-end development), learning to code in PHP; etc.

### At my own time / self-taught

Technically speaking, I started up with programming when I did my Raspberry Pi project in high school, got to be a tad bit familiar with Python. Ever since I went to vocational school / college, I started to intensively get into more programming. From that point, I picked up Node.js when I wanted to make my own Discord text bot. Then after that I picked up Raspberry Pi and learned Python. Some time later, I got my first Arduino board and with it, picked up C++ (Arduino version of C++, kind of). Had various of interests in many technologies, languages, and so on.

## Some other info

I love to ride my bicycle. I used to produce electronic music actively for 4-5 years (stopped around 2019, currently on hiatus). I enjoy making YouTube videos, editing them.
